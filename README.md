# TI-84 Style Graphing Calculator Emulator

As part of my Python programming practice, I developed a TI-84-style scientific calculator emulator that performs mathematical operations and graphs functions, emulating the experience of using a TI-84 calculator. The emulator supports arithmetic, trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions, logarithms, square roots, factorials, and constants like pi and e. Users can switch between degree and radian modes, and reuse previous results using the Ans variable. The project is built using Python's `math`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` libraries to create the best TI-84 calculator I could using my programming skills. This project highlights my ability to apply core programming concepts such as input handling, conditionals, and data visualization in a functional, user-friendly tool.

## Features
- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan)
- Logarithms, square roots, and factorials
- Mathematical constants (pi, e)
- Degree and radian mode switching
- Ans variable to reuse previous results
- Function graphing with matplotlib
- Input validation for error handling

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming fundamentals
- Input handling and validation
- Use of standard libraries (`math`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`)
- Data visualization and plotting
- Implementation of calculator logic and state management
- User-friendly interface design

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed:
   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the calculator:
4. Enter mathematical expressions or functions to graph. Use `Ans` to reference the previous result. Switch between degree and radian modes as needed.

**Example:**
```
TI-84 Emulator!
Supports +, -, *, /, ^, sin(), cos(), tan(), asin(), acos(),
atan(), log(), sqrt(), log()/ln() pi/e and abs value
Switch between degree/radian mode with: 'mode deg' or 'mode rad'
Input 'graph: (function)' to graph. Input 'exit' to quit.
2 + 2
= 4
```
